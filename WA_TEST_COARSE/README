Here you should find  all needed files to run this TC WA example.
There are 2 python scripts 1) to plot stations and (2)  for spatial variables (maps)

Flowchart:
1) Run the model for 7 days (2019/03/18 - 2019/03/25) and save history.nc, 
station.nc, hotfile_out.nc (use wwminput_forward.nml -> copy that in wwminput.nml)
2) make plots for station 0, 1 and say 5 using: python3 plot_station.py station.nc
--station=0 --out_path=./ (see --help). You can make spatial maps for HS if want.
Don't forget to copy history.nc and station.nc in folder ./forward_save for later reference.

3) run wwm again for 4 days but starting 3 days later (2019/03/21) 
using hotstart - record 4  (keep boundary and wind forcing sections the same). 
This is setup in wwminput_restart.nml, so just copy that over wwminput.nml 
4) make plots and compare for period when they overlap.
